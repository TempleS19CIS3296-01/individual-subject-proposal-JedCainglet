## Project Abstract
Signal by Open Whisper Systems is a private messaging app available on Android and iOS devices, as well as on desktop. The open source repository in question is for the Android version of the app, as the majority of the code is in Java. The repo for the iOS version is mostly in Objective-C, while the repo for the desktop version is in JavaScript, with support for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Boasting the tagline "privacy that fits in your pocket", Signal is a fast, simple, and secure messaging service with extra emphasis on secure messaging. As an open source project supported by grants and donations, Signal has already been released in the app stores; however, the project is not yet complete, as there are bugs and issues to address within its various versions.

## Project Relevance
This project is relevant to the course in the aspects of Version Control _(seeing how the code was created and revised over time, thus allowing us to identify the bugs as they appeared over time)_, Debugging _(being able to understand the code that other contributers have provided and being able to revise them)_, and Issue Tracking _(proposing issues that have been noticed through use of the project / debugging, as well as working on resolving issues that have already been noticed)_. Being an open source app, Signal gives us the opportunity to contribute to the design, development, and maintenance aspect of the project. Issues that have been brought up in the repository range from UI bugs to network connectivity and transmission issues.
